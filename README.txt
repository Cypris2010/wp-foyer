== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I set up my slideshow on my digital sign? =
1. In WordPress go to _Slides_ and add some.
1. Go to _Channels_, add one, and add some of you slides.
1. Go to _Displays_, add one, and subscribe it to your channel.
1. Preview the display, note the URL (something like http://your.site/foyer/display-number-one), and load this page in the web browser of your digital sign.

Your digital sign will now display the channel it is subscribed to. If you change the channel for this display in WordPress, the digital sign will change with it. You can even schedule channels on displays.

Set up a display for each digital sign for maximum remote flexibility.

= What hardware should I use for my digital sign? =
Generally speaking you need a computer with a web browser and internet connection, and a display linked to that computer. A Smart TV with built in web browser might work, but maybe not as reliable.

I recommend using a (mini-)computer with the Chrome browser in kiosk mode, and a Full HD (1920 x 1080) display.

When setting up multiple digital signs with their own content, each display needs its own (mini-)computer.

= Landscape or portrait? =
You choose! Install your digital sign the way you prefer. Foyer will follow. Slide templates are designed to work in both landscape and portrait mode. Only the background image will be cropped differently, of course.

= Can I change the looks of slides? =
Yes, this is possible if you know how to write CSS. Just include some CSS in the theme of your website that targets the slide HTML. If you don't have access to the theme you can use a custom CSS plugin to add some CSS.

= Can I change the template of a slide format? Can I add my own slide formats? =
Yes, this is possible if you know how to write WordPress templates. Documentation for developers is coming soon.
