# Foyer for WordPress

A free Digital Signage / Narrowcasting plugin for WordPress.

Create slideshows and show them off on any networked display. Hardware not included :-)

# Forked and new development

The project form mennolui seemed inactive but we are using the plugin and needed some more fratures:

* Scheduling of slides in a channel (implemented)
* Scheduling of more than one channel for a display (implemented)
* Scheduler for global scheduling for multiple channels on muliple displays (development)
* New types of slides (planned)
* Splied channels for showing two channels on one display (planed)

My code is not clean at the moment but it works ;)
